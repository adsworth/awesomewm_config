# awesomewm_config

my configuration for the awesome tiling window manager.
This is still a massive work in progress as I only just switched.

the theme is based on the default zenburn theme.

## tags
one thing that is different from the default setup is the handling of tags.
I have only list of tags, that I split across all my available screens.

## clients
I use the useless_gap feature as I like the look. :)
